\begin{enumerate}
\item \points{7} 
Show that if $X$ has rank $p$ (all its columns are linearly independent) and $n > p$ 
then using the $p$-dimensional pseudo-inverse $X^+ = V_k \Lambda_k^{-1} U_k^T$ in $\hat{w} = X^+ y$ with $k=p$
solves the least squares problem
$\hat{w} = argmin_w (y - Xw)^T(y-Xw)$.


\item \points{7} 
We want to efficiently find the largest eigenvectors of the matrix $X^TX$ where  $X$ is $n * p$ with $p \gg n$.
Show how to do this using the largest eigenvectors of $XX^T$
